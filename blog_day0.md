# Day 0 - The Why
Let me tell you who I am to begin with. 
I`m software developer, a young one (I think)... and I have a common 'shiny project' syndrome. And that is, I try to code houndred of projects, but i can never end any. I have notebooks and notes with ideas, some with details, some with nothing. But always keep leaving behind one, to start a new one that shine more. Well, why not create a new project, one that help me to control myself finishing the others. One ri..project to rule them all. So I started a blog (this blog) with daily/weekly challanges that are part of other projects.
